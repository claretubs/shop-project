## Background
The purpose of the project is the implementation of a simple shop simulation. This was done using procedural python, object-oriented python and structs in C. The simulation involves creating a shop, stocking it with products, creating customers with shopping lists, processing transactions, and managing the overall state of the shop and customer interactions. This project demonstrates basic concepts related to managing shop inventory, customer interactions, and transaction processing.

## How to Run Code
1. Install Ananconda.
2. Install C/C++ Compilier
3. Install VS Code.
4. Clone Repository.
5. Open repository in VS Code.
6. Each programming paradigm to be ran seperately in their seperate folders.
     - Procedural Programming Shop - <code>python shop.py</code>
     - Object-Oriented Programming Shop - <code>python shop.py</code>
     - C Struct Shop - <code>gcc shop.c -o shop</code>
                       <code>./shop</code>
7. To test the different CSV files, uncomment them in the code.
